<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

I wrote this package when I was working at [DECATHLON - GEONAUTE](https://www.decathlon.fr/sport/c0-tous-les-sports/c1-course-d-orientation/_/N-13kthf7) on the improvement of orienteering compasses, as a Research and Development Engineer.

The goal of the project was to model the dynamic behavior of an orienteering compass. Specifically, I was working on the balance, the stability and the rapidity of the needle.

For more on the concepts of balance, stability and rapidity of orienteeering compasses, you can read these two blog posts (in French):
- [How does a compass work? - part 1](https://interpost.fr/article?id=19)
- [How does a compass work? - part 2](https://interpost.fr/article?id=27)

This Research and Development work was notably done for the design of the [R900 GEONAUTE compass](https://www.decathlon.fr/p/boussole-pouce-gauche-pour-course-d-orientation-racer-900-noir/_/R-p-313026?mc=8576047), the high-end product of GEONAUTE's range.
